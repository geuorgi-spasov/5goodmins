/**
 * The two halves of ADR-005's "sending is an after-commit event", measured
 * rather than asserted in a comment.
 *
 * <p>Those two halves are separate bugs and are tested separately:
 * {@code AFTER_COMMIT} is why a rolled-back registration sends no link, and the
 * mail pool is why the provider's latency never reaches the thread that is
 * answering the user -- which is what keeps the registration form from becoming
 * an account-enumeration oracle again. The third thing tested here is what
 * happens when that pool is full, which is the failure mode its bounded queue
 * exists to produce.
 *
 * <p>A {@code @SpringBootTest} rather than a unit test, because what is under
 * test is wiring: transaction-bound event delivery, a proxy that dispatches to
 * a named executor, two template resolvers, and two message bundles. Every one
 * of those is a thing that works in a hand-built object graph and fails in the
 * application. The transaction is driven by a {@link TransactionTemplate} here
 * rather than by {@code @Transactional} on the test, for the one reason that
 * matters: a test-managed transaction is rolled back, and an after-commit
 * listener in a transaction that never commits does nothing at all.
 *
 * <p>No mail leaves: {@link RecordingSender} is {@code @Primary} and replaces
 * the sender the application wires. Nothing here points at Mailpit.
