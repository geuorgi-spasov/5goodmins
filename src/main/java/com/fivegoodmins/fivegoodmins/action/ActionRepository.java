     * plus an {@code ends_at} in the future, computed per query -- there is no
     * {@code EXPIRED} status and no job that sets one, because a status column
     * that depends on the clock is a column that is wrong between runs.

     * <p><strong>{@code now} is a parameter, not {@code CURRENT_TIMESTAMP}.</strong>
     * ADR-019: the caller passes the instant, so a test can ask what this
     * returns on a day of its choosing instead of arranging fixtures around the
     * real calendar.
     *
     * <p><strong>The ordering carries its tiebreaker,</strong> and the pair is
     * not decoration: two actions published in one transaction share a
     * {@code published_at} to the microsecond, and without {@code id desc} the
     * database may return them in either order -- so "the five newest" would
     * quietly differ between two identical requests. The column order also
     * matches {@code idx_action_published} exactly, tiebreaker included, so the
     * sort comes free from the index scan rather than from a sort node.
     *
     * <p>{@code Limit} rather than {@code Pageable}: there is no page, no offset
     * and no total to pay for. Five is a cap, not a window.
