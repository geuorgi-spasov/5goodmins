/**
 * Sends the two registration emails, after the transaction that caused them has
 * committed and off the thread that is answering the user (ADR-005).
 *
 * <p>Two mechanisms, two different bugs, and keeping them apart is the point:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>{@code AFTER_COMMIT} is correctness.</strong> A send inside the
 *       transaction goes out even when the transaction later rolls back, so
 *       someone receives a verification link for an account that does not
 *       exist -- and because the token signs a user id that was never
 *       committed, that link resolves to nothing for as long as it lives.</li>
 *   <li><strong>The executor is the timing oracle.</strong> An after-commit
 *       listener runs on the publishing thread, so without one the HTTP
 *       response waits for the mail provider: 100-500ms on the path that
 *       registers and none on the path that refuses, which tells a stopwatch
 *       what the identical pages will not.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>The submit is explicit rather than {@code @Async}, and that is a
 * measured decision.</strong> ADR-005 specified the annotation, and it works --
 * until the queue fills. Rejection happens at submit time, which with
 * {@code @Async} is inside Spring's transaction synchronization: the
 * {@code TaskRejectedException} propagates out of the proxy, past this class
 * entirely, and lands in {@code TransactionSynchronizationUtils}, which logs
 * <em>"TransactionSynchronization.afterCompletion threw exception"</em> and the
 * stack trace. No account id, no address, nothing saying it was an email --
 * because at that point the event is no longer in scope. Neither the catch
 * below nor an {@code AsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler} sees it; both cover
 * failures <em>inside</em> the task. Measured by saturating the queue, not
 * reasoned about. Submitting by hand is three lines and puts the rejection
 * where the event still is.
 *
 * <p>What the explicit submit costs: the request thread does the submitting, a
 * few microseconds, on both registration paths equally. What it buys: the one
 * failure this design is built to produce is attributable.
 *
 * <p><strong>A failure rolls nothing back</strong>, which is right -- an
 * account should not be undone because a mail provider was briefly down -- and
 * is therefore only as good as its logging. Both failure modes are logged with
 * the user id: the send that threw, and the send that was never attempted.
 *
 * <p><strong>The user's half of that has to exist too.</strong> With no resend
 * form (ADR-002), their recovery is to register again -- which replaces the
 * row and issues a fresh link, so it really is a resend -- and the rate limit
 * on {@code /register} is what keeps it from being a way to flood a mailbox.
 * A recovery nobody is told about is not one, so the "check your inbox" page
 * carries it (frontend brief, page 8; the strings are
 * {@code verification.notice.spam} and {@code verification.notice.resend}).

    /**
     * ADR-002's per-recipient cap on registration email, applied here rather
     * than in {@code RateLimitFilter} where it started.
     *
     * <p><strong>Why it moved.</strong> Keyed on the submitted address, a cap
     * that refuses the <em>request</em> lets three POSTs naming
     * {@code victim@example.com} lock the real owner of that address out of
     * registering for a day -- the denial-of-service weapon ADR-002 rejects
     * account lockout for, rebuilt on the registration form, and reachable
     * without a session or a CSRF token because the filter sits in front of
     * {@code CsrfFilter}. The cap's own stated job is to protect a stranger's
     * inbox rather than this server, so the send is where it belongs: the
     * mailbox is still protected, the owner is refused nothing, and
     * {@code /register} keeps the one neutral response every address must get.
     *
     * <p><strong>What it costs, stated plainly.</strong> A suppressed send is
     * an email that never arrives, and the recovery on page 8 of the frontend
     * brief -- register again -- will not produce one either until the window
     * passes. So an attacker can still deny a targeted address its
     * <em>email</em> for a day; what they can no longer do is deny it the
     * account. That is a strictly smaller weapon and it is the smallest one
     * available, because no cap on mail to an address can both bound the mail
     * and guarantee the next message gets through.
     *
     * <p><strong>The welcome email is exempt</strong>, because it cannot be
     * used as a cannon: reaching it requires a valid signed token for that
     * account, which only the mailbox's reader has. Capping it would mean a
     * user who confirms after an attacker has spent the allowance is welcomed
     * by silence.
     *
     * <p>The address is normalized again here rather than trusted. Both
     * registration events carry it read back from the row, so it is already
     * canonical -- but a cap bypassed by a capital letter is the kind of
     * defect that survives review, and this costs one call.
