/**
 * Creating an account, confirming the address it claims, and removing the
 * accounts that never confirmed one (ADR-002).
 *
 * <p>Three rules, and all three exist for the same reason: the email address
 * is the product. It is the digest destination (ADR-005), the login
 * identifier, and the only thing linking a row to a person. An address nobody
 * proved they can read produces bounces and spam complaints, and those damage
 * deliverability for every future email to every other user.
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><strong>Verification is mandatory.</strong> A new account cannot log
 *       in and receives no mail until {@code email_verified_at} is set. The
 *       gate is in {@code AppUserDetailsService}, above Spring Security's own
 *       status checks, so that an unverified address is not distinguishable
 *       from an unknown one at the login form.</li>
 *   <li><strong>An unverified address can be taken over.</strong> Registering
 *       over an existing unverified row is allowed, so that typing someone
 *       else's address cannot squat it. See {@link #register}.</li>
 *   <li><strong>Unverified rows are purged after seven days</strong>, on the
 *       same window as the verification token's lifetime.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><strong>This is not a DDoS defence</strong> and must not be argued as
 * one: a flood of traffic never completes a registration. It raises the cost
 * of fake accounts, and that is all. Volume is Cloudflare's job, and
 * per-IP/per-address limits on this endpoint are Bucket4j's (ADR-002) --
 * notably because {@link #register} will happily email the owner of an
 * unverified address once per request until it is capped.

     *
     * <p>Updating the row in place would leave the previous occupant's
     * verification token valid: same user id, same key, same purpose, so it
     * still verifies. The damaging direction is the one that looks harmless.
     * Suppose the real owner registers first, does not click the link, and
     * someone else then re-registers over the row with a password of their
     * own. If the row survives, the owner's original link -- sitting in their
     * own mailbox, from a registration they really made -- verifies the
     * stranger's account. They would then be looking at a confirmed account on
     * their own address whose password they do not know.
     *
     * <p>Deleting and inserting makes the superseded token resolve to a row
     * that no longer exists, so it fails as {@link
     * EmailVerificationOutcome.DeadLink}. That is revocation without a
     * revocation list, which is the only way to get it when the token carries
     * its own claims and there is no token table.
     *
     * <p>The explicit {@code flush()} between the two is load-bearing.
     * Hibernate orders inserts before deletes within a flush, so without it
     * both statements reach the database in the wrong order and the INSERT
     * fails on uq_app_user_email -- for a case that is supposed to work.
     *
     * <p><strong>A verified address returns {@link
     * RegistrationOutcome.AddressTaken} and writes nothing.</strong> The caller
     * renders the identical "check your inbox" page for both outcomes; see
     * {@link RegistrationOutcome}.
     *
     * <p><strong>The concurrent case is left to the database.</strong> Two
     * simultaneous registrations for the same free address can both pass the
     * lookup above and both insert; uq_app_user_email rejects the loser with a
     * {@code DataIntegrityViolationException}, which propagates. No duplicate
     * row is ever created -- the constraint is what guarantees that, not the
     * check -- and the cost is that one of two users racing for the same
     * address in the same millisecond sees an error page and succeeds on retry.
     * Catching it here is not possible as written: a constraint violation
     * marks the transaction rollback-only, so returning a tidy outcome from
     * inside it would fail again at commit. The fix, if it ever matters, is to
     * catch it outside the transaction boundary.
     *
