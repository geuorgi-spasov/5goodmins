/**
 * What {@link RegistrationService#register} asks to be emailed once its
 * transaction has committed (ADR-005).
 *
 * <p><strong>Both registration outcomes publish one of these, and that is the
 * requirement rather than a convention.</strong> {@code register} renders the
 * same page for a free address and for an address that already has a confirmed
 * account, and pays a BCrypt hash on both paths so the two cannot be told apart
 * with a stopwatch. An email sent on one path and not the other would undo
 * that: an HTTP call to a mail provider is 100-500ms, several times the gap
 * hashing on both paths closes. Two events through one listener keeps the two
 * paths the same shape as well as the same page.
 *
 * <p><strong>It carries values, not the entity.</strong> By the time a
 * {@code @TransactionalEventListener(AFTER_COMMIT)} runs, the transaction is
 * finished and the persistence context is gone, so an {@code AppUser} in here
 * would be a detached object whose next lazy access throws on a pool thread --
 * and entities do not leave the service layer anyway (ADR-013).
 *
 * <p>Sealed, so the listener's {@code switch} is exhaustive without a default
 * branch: a third registration email would be a compile error there rather
 * than an email that is quietly never sent.
