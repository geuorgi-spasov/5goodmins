/**
 * ADR-002's rate limiting, on {@code POST /login} and {@code POST /register}
 * and nothing else.
 *
 * <p><strong>The key is {@code request.getRemoteAddr()}, never a header.</strong>
 * The reasoning is ADR-002's and is not repeated here, but the consequence for
 * this class is: it parses no headers at all. Tomcat's {@code RemoteIpValve}
 * has already walked {@code X-Forwarded-For} by the time any filter runs, and
 * {@code server.tomcat.remoteip.trusted-proxies} in application.yaml is what
 * makes it walk past Cloudflare's edge to the real client.
 *
 * <p><strong>Placed before {@code CsrfFilter}, not after it.</strong> This is a
 * choice with a cost on both sides. Before, a spray with no CSRF token is
 * refused here and never reaches a session lookup, which is what a limiter is
 * for -- and an attacker is one GET away from a valid token anyway, so ordering
 * it after buys no protection. The cost is that a client with an expired
 * session, resubmitting a form it cannot succeed with, spends its own
 * allowance on 403s. That is the less surprising of the two, because those
 * really are failed attempts from that address.
 *
 * <p><strong>A rejection is {@code 429} through the error dispatch</strong>
 * rather than a response written here, so the day page 19 of the frontend
 * brief lands this gets a real page in the site layout with the rest of them.
 * Until then it is the whitelabel error page, which is the same state every
 * other error is in -- and {@code Retry-After} is set first, so the page has a
 * number to say when there is a page to say it on. Writing a body here instead
 * would mean a user-facing string in Java, which ADR-008 forbids, or a blank
 * page, which tells a human nothing.
 *
 * <p><strong>Nothing in here is keyed on anything a stranger can name for
 * somebody else, and that is a correction rather than a design note.</strong>
 * The first version of this filter also spent a bucket keyed on the submitted
 * email address, which made three POSTs enough to lock the real owner of a
 * known address out of registering for a day -- account lockout rebuilt on the
 * registration form, against the explicit reasoning in ADR-002. That cap still
 * exists and still protects the same inbox; it now refuses the <em>send</em>
 * instead, in {@code RegistrationEmailListener}. The rule this filter keeps is
 * narrow and worth stating: a bucket that can refuse a request may only be
 * keyed on something the requester cannot choose on somebody else's behalf,
 * which leaves the client address.
 *
 * <p>Two things fall out of that. This filter reads no request parameter, so it
 * never parses a request body and the multipart caveat the first version needed
 * is gone. And {@code POST /register} has exactly one response it can produce
 * here, so the neutral page ADR-002 requires for every address is intact.
 *
 * <p><strong>The rejection log line is the measurement ADR-002 asked for.</strong>
 * It reports the resolved bucket key next to the raw remote address, which is
 * the only thing in the application that reports what the valve resolved -- so
 * twenty-one POSTs at the deployed site answer whether Railway's proxy appends
 * to {@code X-Forwarded-For} or passes it through, without an echo endpoint
 * that would have to be built and then removed. The cost is one WARN per
 * refused request, which under a sustained attack is a log line per request;
 * the fix, if that ever matters, is one line per key per window behind a
 * second cache, and it is not worth the state today.
